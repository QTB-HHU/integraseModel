This repository contains two versions of the integrase models.

## Full model

In directory "fullModel" the MATLAB files are provided to simulate the in vitro experiments with and without Reaction Directionality Factors (RDFs), which
were presented in the manuscript:

Pokhilko et al (2016). 
The mechanism of Ï•C31 integrase directionality: experimental analysis and computational modelling.
Nucleic Acids Res. 44(15):7360-72. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkw616. 

## Minimal model

In the directory "minimalModel" a highly reduced model is presented, which illustrates the principles how the reversibility is achieved without violating fundamental thermodynamic principles.
The paper is currently under revision.
